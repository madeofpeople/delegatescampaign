  "readme": "\n# metalsmith-include\n\n  Make the contents of other source files as properties on a metalsmith file object. Can be used as a rudimentary partial system for `metalsmith-templates`.\n\n## Example\n\nindex.md:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntemplate: home.jade\ninclude:\n  thanks: thanks.md\n---\n\n### Welcome to my website!\n```\n\nhome.jade:\n\n```jade\n.main\n  !=contents\n\n  .thanks\n    !=thanks\n```\n\nthanks.md:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntemplate: thanks.jade\npartial: true\n---\n\n#### Thanks for visiting!\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"main\">\n  <h3>Welcome to my website!</h3>\n\n  <div class=\"thanks\">\n    <h4>Thanks for visiting!</h4>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install metalsmith-include\n\n## Options\n  \n  The only option is `deletePartials`, which tells `metalsmith-include` whether or not to remove files that are included in other files, and have a `partial` indicator in their front-matter. Defaults to true.\n\n## CLI Usage\n\n  Install via npm and then add the `metalsmith-include` key to your `metalsmith.json` plugins with your options passed as an object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": {\n    \"metalsmith-include\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Javascript Usage\n\n  Pass `options` to the include plugin and pass it to Metalsmith with the `use` method:\n\n```js\nvar include = require('metalsmith-include');\n\nmetalsmith.use(include());\n```\n\n## License\n\n  MIT\n",
